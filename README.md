# Tools I used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools: 
- **SQL**: The bankbone of analysis, allowing me to quert the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chose database management system, ideal for handling the job-posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL  queries. 
- **Git & Github**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scrips and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking. 

# The Analysis 
Each query for this project aimed at investigation the specifict aspect of the data analyst job market. Here is how I approached each question:

### 1. Top paying data analyst jobs.
To identify the highest paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high-paying opportunities in the field. 

``` sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    name AS company_name,
    job_title,
    job_location, 
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
        
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON 
    job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
--AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### 2. Top paying job skills.
``` sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (

    SELECT
        job_id,
        name AS company_name,
        job_title,  
        salary_year_avg       
        
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON 
        job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    --AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
    )
SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
    FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id=skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
```
### 3. Top demanded skills in data analyst joba market. 

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY skills           
ORDER BY demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```
### 4. Top paying skills in the date job market. 

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
ROUND( AVG(salary_year_avg),0) AS average_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
AND salary_year_avg is NOT NULL
GROUP BY skills           
ORDER BY average_salary DESC
LIMIT 25
```

)
SELECT
    skills_demand.skill_id,
    skills_demand.skills,
    skills_demand.demand_count,
    average_salary.avg_salary
FROM
    skills_demand
INNER JOIN average_salary ON skills_demand.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
WHERE
    demand_count >10
ORDER by 
    avg_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC
   
    LIMIT 25
